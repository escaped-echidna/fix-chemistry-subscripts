# fix-chemistry-subscripts
Bash script which adds subscript/superscript tags to chemical formulas

I used this to properly format the chemical abbreviations for nitrous oxide (N2O) nitrate (NO3-) and other compounds relevant to my PhD work. This was primarily used in my plain-text notes (I was using notational velocity) but could be used in bibtex plain-text references to make it easier to deal with chemical formulas in a bibliography.
